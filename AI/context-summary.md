### üèóÔ∏è **CODE MODULARIZATION & DOWNLOAD FEATURE** - COMPLETED (May 25, 2025)
1. **‚úÖ Actions Modularization**: Split large `actions.ts` (516 lines) into focused modules:
   - `shared.ts` - Server action utilities (getCurrentUserId)
   - `employee-actions.ts` - Employee CRUD operations
   - `project-actions.ts` - Project CRUD operations
   - `task-actions.ts` - Task management and assignment operations
   - `salary-actions.ts` - Salary operations + export utilities
   - Maintained backward compatibility with re-exports from main `actions.ts`

2. **‚úÖ Component Modularization**: Refactored salary management into focused components:
   - Reduced main client from 728 lines to 284 lines (61% reduction)
   - Created 6 specialized components in `src/components/salary/`:

   - Created `src/lib/types/salary-types.ts` for shared component interfaces
   - Fixed TypeScript compilation issues across all action modules
   - Implemented consistent `ActionResponse<T>` interface with utilities

5. **‚úÖ Build System Fixes**: Resolved all compilation errors and ESLint issues
   - Fixed server action vs utility function separation
   - Corrected TypeScript type mismatches between database models and interfaces
   - Ensured production build passes without errors

### üéØ Advanced Kanban Board - FULL FEATURE SET
1. **‚úÖ Priority Sorting**: Tasks sortable by priority (URGENT ‚Üí HIGH ‚Üí MEDIUM ‚Üí LOW) per column
2. **‚úÖ UX Enhancements**: Visual indicators, hover effects, sorting controls with reset
3. **‚úÖ Collapsible Columns**: Smart task limiting with expand/collapse functionality  
4. **‚úÖ View Modes**: Compact vs Relaxed views with different spacing and heights
5. **‚úÖ Clickable Task Cards**: Detailed modal popup for viewing and editing tasks
6. **‚úÖ Task Detail Modal**: Full editing interface with status/priority changes
7. **‚úÖ Drag & Drop Integration**: Seamless interaction between clicking and dragging

### üîß Technical Implementation Details:
- **Priority System**: Weighted sorting (URGENT: 4, HIGH: 3, MEDIUM: 2, LOW: 1)
- **State Management**: Column-specific sorting, expansion states, view modes
- **Task Visibility**: 3 tasks (compact) / 5 tasks (relaxed) with "Show more" controls
- **Modal Features**: Edit mode toggle, form validation, project/team info display
- **Responsive Design**: Mobile-friendly with proper touch interactions
- **Task Editing**: Full CRUD operations with database persistence for all task fields

### üöÄ Recently Completed Critical Fix (May 24, 2025):
**‚úÖ TASK EDITING PERSISTENCE BUG FIXED**: Resolved critical issue where task edits (title, description, priority) weren't being saved to database
- **Root Cause**: `handleTaskUpdate` function only handled status changes, ignored other field updates
- **Solution**: Created comprehensive `updateTask` server action in `/lib/actions.ts`
- **Implementation**: Updated kanban board to use new action for all task field updates
- **Validation**: Added proper TypeScript typing and Zod schema validation
- **Result**: All task editing now properly persists to database with immediate UI updates

### üöÄ Previously Completed Kanban Fixes:
1. **React Hydration Mismatch**: Fixed by implementing client-side mounting pattern for DndContext
2. **Drag-and-Drop Logic**: Fixed handling of drops on tasks vs. columns to correctly determine target status
3. **Multiple Cards Display**: All tasks now display properly in columns (no 2-card limit)
4. **Cross-Column Dragging**: Tasks can be dragged between all status columns successfully
